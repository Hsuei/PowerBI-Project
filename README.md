Executive Summary & Core Metrics

Total Revenue: $9.84 Million (M).

Total Quantity (Qty): 5 Million (M) units sold.

Total Customers: 4,220 unique customers.

Insight: The business has a low total customer count (4,220) relative to the high volume of transactions (5M Qty). This strongly suggests a B2B or wholesale model where a small number of key customers drive a large portion of the revenue and volume.

Sales Insights Summary

The business exhibits extreme seasonality and high concentration risk.

Seasonal Dependence: Revenue is flat from January through August ($0.69M to $0.72M) but sees exponential growth in Q4, peaking in December at $1.5M, which is double the average early-year revenue. The business is heavily reliant on the year-end buying cycle.

Customer Risk: There is extreme customer concentration, with the top few customers (e.g., ID 14646 at $0.27M) driving a disproportionately large share of total revenue. Losing one of these key accounts poses a major risk.

Geographic Concentration: Sales are dominated by the Netherlands (highest revenue at $0.27M) and EIRE (highest quantity). The high quantity/lower revenue in EIRE suggests a potential pricing disparity (higher volume/lower margin).

Key Recommendations

Flatten Seasonal Dip: Implement targeted promotions/incentives during the May-August period to pull forward revenue and reduce reliance on Q4.

Mitigate Concentration Risk: Actively diversify the customer portfolio by nurturing the "Tier 2" customer segment to reduce vulnerability to top-customer churn.

Investigate Pricing: Analyze the Average Selling Price (ASP) in EIRE to ensure the high sales volume is not eroding profit margins due to excessive discounts.

Optimize Low-Performing Markets: Review the operational cost of serving low-revenue countries like Spain, Japan, and Norway, and reallocate resources to high-impact markets.
